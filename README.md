__Linux Access Node__ is an educational platform designed to give students access to Linux terminals through Docker containers. This project aims to provide an environment where students can practice Linux commands and concepts directly from a web interface. It's especially useful for courses in computer networks and systems administration, where hands-on experience with Linux is essential for mastering key skills.

# Key Features

**Web-based Linux terminals:** No installation required, accessible through a browser.

**Authentication and user management:** Each student has their own account, ensuring personalized and secure access.

**Persistent progress:** Student progress is saved inside the Docker container, allowing them to continue where they left off.

**Hands-on learning:** Students can practice networking and Linux fundamentals in a real-world environment.
